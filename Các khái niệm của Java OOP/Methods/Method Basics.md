# Defining a Method

A method definition consists of method name, parameters, return value type, and body.
The syntax for defining a method is as follows:

```java
modifier returnValueType methodName(list of parameters) {
// Method body;
}
```

**Caution**: In the method header, you need to declare each parameter separately. For instance,
max(int num1, int num2) is correct, but max(int num1, num2) is wrong.
