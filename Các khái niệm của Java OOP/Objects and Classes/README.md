# Objects and Classes

## Objectives

- To describe objects and classes, and use classes to model objects.
- To use UML graphical notation to describe classes and objects).
- To demonstrate how to define classes and create objects.
- To create objects using constructors).
- To access objects via object reference variables).
- To define a reference variable using a reference type.
- To access an object’s data and methods using the object member access
operator (.).
- To define data fields of reference types and assign default values for
an object’s data fields.
- To distinguish between object reference variables and primitive-datatype variables.
- To use the Java library classes Date, Random, and Point2D.
- To distinguish between instance and static variables and methods.
- To define private data fields with appropriate getter and setter methods.
- To encapsulate data fields to make classes easy to maintain.
- To develop methods with object arguments and differentiate between
primitive-type arguments and object-type arguments.
- To store and process objects in arrays.
- To create immutable objects from immutable classes to protect the
contents of objects.
- To determine the scope of variables in the context of a class.
- To use the keyword this to refer to the calling object itself.
