# Identifiers

*Identifiers are the names that identify the elements such as classes, methods, and
variables in a program.*

All identifiers must obey the following rules:
- An identifier is a sequence of characters that consists of letters, digits, underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).
- An identifier must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). *It cannot start with a digit*.
- An identifier cannot be a reserved word.

- An identifier cannot be **true**, **false**, or **null**.
- An identifier can be of any length.

**Note**:
Since Java is case sensitive, area, Area, and AREA are all different identifiers.

**Tip**:

Identifiers are for naming variables, methods, classes, and other items in a program.
Descriptive identifiers make programs easy to read. Avoid using abbreviations for identifiers. Using complete words is more descriptive. For example, numberOfStudents
is better than numStuds, numOfStuds, or numOfStudents. We use descriptive
names for complete programs in the text. However, we will occasionally use variable
names such as i, j, k, x, and y in the code snippets for brevity. These names also
provide a generic tone to the code snippets.
Tip
Do not name identifiers with the $ character. By convention, the $ character should be
used only in mechanically generated source code.
